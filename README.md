# GitHub Actions / CI CD Pipline
This application can be deployed to production using just one click on `GitHub Actions`.
 
Make sure, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` are created/updated with valid credentials.

Go to Actions>> .github/workflows/aws-deploy.yml >> Run Workflow

# Infrastructure-as-Code
The entire application has two `AWS Cloudformation` stacks: `InfrastructureStack`, `QRCodeFlaskServerStack`. All three cloudformation stacks are deployed to `AWS` using [`AWS Cloud Development Kit`](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). 

This `cdk` application is a `Java` based. Make sure `node`, `aws-cdk`, `aws-cli`, `java`, `mvn` are installed on software release machine. 

# Future Plans/Improvements
- [ ] Add better front-end to interact with the application. 
- [ ] Integrate `stripe payment gateway` to the application. 
- [ ] Write test cases to acheive 100% `coverage`.
